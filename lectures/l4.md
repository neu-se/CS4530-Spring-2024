### Learning Objectives:
This lecture is about writing code that other people will be able to understand, reuse, and modify. Weâ€™ve distilled this down to five general program-design princples which should be best practices for effective programmers:
* Use Good Names
* Make Your Data Mean Something
* One Method/One Job
* Don't Repeat Yourself
* Don't Hardcode Things That Are Likely To Change


In this lecture, you will learn to:

* Describe the purpose of our best practices for code-level design
* List 5 principles for designing readable code, with examples
* Identify some violations of the practices and suggest ways to mitigate them
