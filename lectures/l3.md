### Learning Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
* Explain different reasons why you might want to test
* Design a TDD test suite by identifying equivalence classes of inputs
* Explain the following measures of code coverage, and how they differ:
  * Statement or line coverage
  * Branch coverage
  * Path coverage
* Use mutation testing to judge the completeness of a test suite
