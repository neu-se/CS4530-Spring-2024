# Specifications for Live PresentationsÂ (Sec 1, Prof. Bell)

There is no required presentation for our section. On Thursday April 11, we will have a demo day, where you can show off your project to the class. We will also collect all of the posters and put them up in one place, so that every student can see each others' demo and poster. We will conclude the session with a post-mortem of the entire course.

Students will *optionally* be able to present their poster and demo to the class. However, this is not required, and will not be graded.
