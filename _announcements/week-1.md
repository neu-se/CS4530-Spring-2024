On behalf of the entire [instructional team](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2024/staff) (all 3 instructors and 15 TAs), welcome to the Spring 2024 edition of CS 4530! [This website](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2024/) will contain all of the lectures, assignments and tutorials for the class. Our [Canvas site](https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/166618) contains your gradebook as well as single-sign-on links to Piazza (for discussion), instructions for submitting assignments and replicates much of the material from the class website.

In advance of the first week of class, we've shared the [calendars for each section](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2024/calendar/), the first two lectures, and tutorials on installing your IDE, Typescript, and unit testing with Jest. The schedule of office hours is also posted and we will start holding office hours from Monday Jan 8th. 

The first [individual project deliverable](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2024/assignments/ip1) is now available. This deliverable is due by January 24th at 11am ET. Your work will be submitted on Autograder.io which can be accessed through neu.autograder.io. Please note the autograding script will impose a strict rate limit of 5 submissions per 24 hours. This limit exists to encourage you to start early on this assignment. Feel free to use piazza to ask questions and use office hours if you need help. We have 75 hours of scheduled TA office hours per week starting today.

We are excited to meet you all this week!
