We have posted the instructions for setting up your team repository. You can find them in the start of the [ CI/CD Pipeline Activity]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link Activities/Module14 Deployment Activity.md %}). Please note that setting up the deployment to Heroku requires creating an account and waiting for it to be manually validated by Heroku. We recommend that you start this process as soon as possible to avoid any delays.
