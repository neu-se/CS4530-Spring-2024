## User Stories and Conditions of Satisfaction

### Introduction

This activity will give you practice with using user stories to solicit and document user requirements, refining them into conditions of satisfaction, and assigning priorities.

Before you start, be sure to review the tutorial [User Stories and Conditions of Satisfaction]({{site.baseurl}}{% link tutorials/week1-user-stories.md %}) on the course website.

### Scenario

Imagine that you are the owner of a restaurant, and your consultant has convinced you that you need to have a web site.  You and they have walked through the material in Module 01 and the Tutorial on User Stories.  Your consultant is also a fan of "systems thinking", by which they mean looking at a problem from many different points of view.

### Requirements for this activity

1. Identify at least 3 different roles representing different points of view
2. Choose one of those roles and write down at least 3 different user stories for that participant.  These should be of the form
   
    As a <code>&lt;role&gt;</code> I want to <code>&lt;some property of the system&gt;</code> so that I can <code>&lt;receive some benefit&gt;</code>

3. For one of those user stories, write 3 conditions of satisfaction with appropriate priority.


When you are done, submit your work as required by your instructor. This may vary from section to section.
