## User Stories and Conditions of Satisfaction

### Introduction

This activity will give you practice with using user stories to solicit and document user requirements, refining them into conditions of satisfaction, and assigning priorities.

Before you start, be sure to review the tutorial [User Stories and Conditions of Satisfaction]({{site.baseurl}}{% link tutorials/week1-user-stories.md %}) on the course website.

Choose one of the two scenarios (as required by your instructor):

### Scenario 1

Imagine that the State of Massachusetts is your client and you are the lead of a development team. You have already walked your client through the material in the tutorial, and together you have developed the following user story:

* As a resident of the State of Massachusetts, I would like to obtain my mail-in ballot so that I can cast my vote by mail.

### Requirements for this activity

1. Write down at least 3 questions that you should ask the client before beginning to write conditions of satisfaction for this user story.
2. Write at least 3 conditions of satisfaction with appropriate priority
3. Then write 3 bad examples of conditions of satisfaction, and briefly say why they are bad.

When you are done, submit your work as required by your instructor. This may vary from section to section.

### Scenario 2

Imagine that you are the owner of a restaurant, and your consultant has convinced you that you need to have a web site.  You and they have walked through the material in Module 01 and the Tutorial on User Stories.  Your consultant is also a fan of "systems thinking", by which they mean looking at a problem from many different points of view.

### Requirements for this activity

1. Identify at least 3 different roles representing different points of view
2. Choose one of those roles and write down at least 3 different user stories for that participant.  These should be of the form
   
    As a <code>&lt;role&gt;</code> I want to <code>&lt;some property of the system&gt;</code> so that I can <code>&lt;receive some benefit&gt;</code>

3. For one of those user stories, write 3 conditions of satisfaction with appropriate priority.

When you are done, submit your work as required by your instructor. This may vary from section to section.
